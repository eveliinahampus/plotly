## Improvements:

### Trend line improvement:

Trendline needs to have a different color to be shown properly. 
Making the points smaller makes distribution and their intensity more visible.

```{python collapsed}

import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np
pio.renderers.default = "notebook"

df = pd.read_csv(
    "./data/survey_results_public.csv", 
    encoding='utf-8', 
    dtype=str
    )

for col in ['ConvertedCompYearly', 'WorkExp']:
    df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col])


```

Let us look at the compensation by age. As always, variables such as income (Annual Compensation) need log transformation to spread properly. Therefore we scale the y-axis by logarithm with base 10. and here is the results:

```{python} 


df["log10_ConvertedCompYearly"] = np.log10(df["ConvertedCompYearly"])

# Removing the null ages
age_hist = df.query("Age != 'Prefer not to say'").loc[:,["Age","log10_ConvertedCompYearly"]].copy()

# Fixing the order of categories here:

sorted_categories = [
    'Under 18 years old',
    '18-24 years old',
    '25-34 years old',
    '35-44 years old',
    '45-54 years old',
    '55-64 years old',
    '65 years or older'
    ]

fig = px.box(
    age_hist, 
    x="Age", y="log10_ConvertedCompYearly", 
    labels={
        'log10_ConvertedCompYearly': 'Annual Compensation (USD)', 
        }
    )

lnx = list(range(0,8,1))
fig.update_layout(
    yaxis=dict(
        tickvals=lnx,  # Set the tick values to the X values
        ticktext=[f'10<sup>{val}</sup>' for val in lnx]  # Format as 10^n
    )
)
fig.update_xaxes(categoryorder='array', categoryarray=sorted_categories)
fig.update_traces(marker=dict(size=2))
fig.show()



```

It appears that the distribution of the income increases until the age of 35, and then the standard deviation decreases.
